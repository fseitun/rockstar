# This is a Challenge submitted to Rockstar Coders on October 2021

The main libraries employed were:

- react
- react-query V6 [(to be released any time soon!)](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases)
- axios

The day I uploaded it I had my API key hardcoded so it could be easily used. If you aren't being able to use it, it's probably that I deleted the API key, you can generate one at [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org) and paste it on [apiKey.js](https://github.com/fseitun/rockstar/blob/4d5fc5913c6e7c8647ff4685b38b04f62dde0e99/src/Components/Assets/apiKey.js#L1)

The UI was minimalistic since RC stated that there was no need to make it shine. For this same reason the app was developed only for computer.

# How to run
